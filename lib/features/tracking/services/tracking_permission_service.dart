/// it relates to Phase 2 tracking requirements.
///
/// Mapped from Phase 2 context decisions D-07 (two-step location flow),
/// D-08 (background-denied banner), D-09 (permanent-deny "open settings"
/// CTA), and UX-03 (persistent foreground notification while recording).
/// Consumers — the home screen pre-flight (plan 02-04) and the
/// service-isolate starter (plan 02-03) — switch on this enum to decide
/// whether Start is enabled, whether to show the limitation banner, and
/// whether to deep-link into system settings.
///
/// The four original variants keep their original semantics — they
/// describe LOCATION state only. The fifth variant, [notificationDenied],
/// is a strict superset-addition introduced by the gap-closure plan
/// 02-1: it means "location is resolved well enough to start tracking,
/// but POST_NOTIFICATIONS is denied" — which on Android 13+ silently
/// blocks the UX-03 foreground notification. Start MUST be disabled in
/// this state.
